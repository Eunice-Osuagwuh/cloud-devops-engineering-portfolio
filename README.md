AWS Cloud Fundamentals & Hands-On Projects
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It contains structured notes and practical projects covering cloud fundamentals, networking, security, and compute services, with a strong focus on real-world implementation.

The goal of this repository is to serve as:

A personal learning reference
A practical AWS portfolio
A demonstration of real-world cloud deployment skills



What This Repository Covers
AWS account setup and best practices
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
AWS Organisations and account governance
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking
EC2 compute and web application deployment
Secure access, networking, and DNS configuration

Project Breakdown
01 – AWS Account Setup

Covers the foundational steps for setting up an AWS environment, including:

AWS account creation

IAM users, groups, roles, and access best practices

AWS Organisations and account governance

02 – VPC Networking

Focuses on AWS networking fundamentals:

VPC creation and design

Public and private subnets

Route tables, Internet Gateway, and NAT concepts

Security Groups vs Network ACLs

03 – EC2 Compute & Web Application Deployment

A hands-on project demonstrating real-world AWS usage:

Launching an EC2 instance inside an existing VPC

Secure server access using SSH

Installing and configuring Nginx on Ubuntu

Deploying a web application from GitHub

Configuring a custom domain and DNS records

Validating public access via IP address and domain name

This project ties together networking, security, compute, and DNS in a practical deployment scenario.



Skills Demonstrated

AWS core services (EC2, VPC, IAM)

Linux server administration

Secure SSH access and key management

Web server configuration (Nginx)

DNS and domain configuration

Cloud troubleshooting and validation

Git and GitHub for documentation and version control



Ongoing Improvements

This repository is actively maintained and will be expanded to include:

Load Balancing (ALB/NLB)

Auto Scaling Groups

Enhanced IAM security practices

High availability architectures
